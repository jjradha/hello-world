
StackOverflow has helped me ask better questions. Often in the process of creating a repro and refining a question into a minimal answerable form, I solve the problem I was experiencing. Sometimes I'll post this as a self-answered SE post. Sometimes I won't. _Sometimes_ I'm never able to refine strange observed behavior into a 500-word-or-less question suitable for SE but I still want to keep playing with the behavior. 

In this subdir, please find examples of rubber-ducking that may or may not have resulted in me learning something productive but that are probably not suitable in current for for sharing elsewhere.
