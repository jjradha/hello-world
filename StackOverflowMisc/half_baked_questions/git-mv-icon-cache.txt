Which git moved and modified file is bugging my icon cache?

tortoisegit git icons caching



ToroiseGit is awesome! Sadly though it doesn't always play nice with `git mv` when also modifying the contents of a file in the same commit. Consider the following scenario.

    mkdir demo
    cd demo
    git init
    mkdir foo bar
    echo bar > bar/bar
    echo bar > bar/foo # oops!
    git add .
    git commit -m "init commit"

...oops, well I better fix that.

    echo foo > bar/foo
    git mv bar/foo foo/foo
    git add .
    git commit -m "un-bar'd the foo"

Much better! But wait... what's up with my iconcache?

I have a repo for which TortoiseGit is showing modified for a fresh clone. I have tried. 

* [`git config core.fileMode false`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1580644/4709762)
* uninstall/reinstall of TortoiseGit
* advancing the branch

`git status` shows `nothing to commit, working tree clean`
